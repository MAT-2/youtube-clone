# Description

This is a Youtube clone I created called Pixel Pulse. This website was designed to mimic the funtionality and ease that Youtube's application provides. Pixel Pulse allows users to search for any video or channel they want to watch, as well as seeing the details of each channel for the subscribers, views and likes.
